After profiling, I discovered it was due to a massive, unoptimized JavaScript bundle and excessive re-renders. My approach involved several steps: first, implementing code splitting and lazy loading for routes and components. Second, I introduced memoization and `useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders in critical components. Third, I migrated some computationally intensive logic to web workers to free up the main thread. Finally, I optimized image assets and leveraged a CDN. The result was a dramatic improvement in both load time and user experience."
