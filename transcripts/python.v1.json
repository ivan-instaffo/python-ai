They act as a single entry point for clients, simplifying API consumption. They handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication/authorization, rate limiting, request/response transformation, and routing to appropriate backend services. This offloads complexity from individual microservices and provides a centralized control plane for API management, improving security and maintainability."

For GDPR/CCPA, I focus on mechanisms for data subject rights (e.g., right to erasure, data portability), and ensure clear data retention policies are implemented and adhered to throughout the system."

Collaboration with frontend is often daily, using shared Jira boards and regular syncs. For DevOps, we have dedicated SREs who work closely with feature teams, but backend engineers are also expected to have a strong 'you build it, you run it' mentality, meaning involvement in deployment and operational aspects."
