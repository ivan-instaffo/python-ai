Instead of just cold calling, I performed an in-depth analysis of recent industry reports, identifying a niche compliance challenge that our software uniquely addressed.

To gauge 'Authority,' I might ask, 'Who else on your team would be involved in a decision like this?' For 'Need,' I delve into 'What would be the impact on your business if this problem isn't resolved?' And for 'Timeline,' 'What's the urgency here?

For 'too busy,' I offer to take literally 30 seconds to explain why I called, and if it's not relevant, they can tell me to hang up.

I'll reference something highly specific to that individual or company: a recent press release, a LinkedIn post they wrote, a shared connection, or even a nuanced insight about their specific market.
