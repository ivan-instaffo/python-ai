# Python AI - Interview Transcript Summarizer

Python developer assessment task for the AI team.

## Scenario

Your team needs a microservice that summarizes interview feedback. Your service will receive a short interview transcript and based on it, it is expected to return:

- A concise summary
- Tags (e.g., "confident", "detailed", "collaborative", "analytical", "enthusiastic", "experienced", "curious", "structured", "innovative", "practical")
- Sentiment analysis

## Requirements

- Write your backend in **FastAPI**
- Use **OpenAI** or **GeminiAPI** for the LLM
- Provide a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run the service
- Your respository should include a README
- Record a short 5-minute video walking through your codebase, decisions and overall approach


## Submission Guidelines

- Work on your solution inside a **private** GitHub repository and invite `@ivan-instaffo` as collaborator upon completion
- Provide a link to your short walk-through video (you can use Loom; anything is fine given it is easily accessible)
- Reach out as soon as you are finished and include the repository as well as the video link
